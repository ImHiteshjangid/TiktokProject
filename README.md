Background on the TikTok scenario

TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner. 
TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

Project background
TikTok’s data team is in the earliest stages of the claims classification project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:

Build a dataframe for the TikTok dataset
Examine data type of each column
Gather descriptive statistics

Your assignment
You will build a dataframe for the claims classification data. After the dataframe is complete, you will organize the claims data for the process of exploratory data analysis, and update the team on your progress and insights.

Specific project deliverables
With this end-of-course project, you will gain valuable practice and apply your new skills as you complete the following:

Course 2 PACE Strategy Document to plan your project while considering your audience members, teammates, key milestones, and overall project goal. 
Answer the questions in the Jupyter notebook project file
Complete coding prep work on project’s Jupyter notebook
Summarize the column Dtypes
Communicate important findings in the form of an executive summary  

TikTok's data team needs you to problem-solve and communicate your findings. Good luck on your tasks!
